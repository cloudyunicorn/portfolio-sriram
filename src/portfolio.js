      why: 'Finding suitable housing in the current market is a difficult task for many users, who face a multitude of challenges when searching for their ideal home. There is a lack of transparency and standardization, making it difficult to find accurate and reliable information about properties, such as their location, price, size, and amenities. Additionally, users often have specific preferences and requirements that must be met when searching for housing, making the process even more difficult. The process of searching for housing can be frustrating and time-consuming, with users often spending a significant amount of time trying to find accurate and up-to-date information on available properties. Therefore, there is a clear need for a user-friendly housing search platform that simplifies the search process and helps the user find the perfect house.',
